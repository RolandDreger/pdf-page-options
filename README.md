# Change page options of placed PDF, AI and INDD files.

This script for Adobe InDesign is useful when working with multi-page PDF, AI or Indd documents. It allows you to change the page (options) of placed PDF, AI or INDD files. InDesign does not support this function by default. To do this, the script adds the item "PDF Page Options ..." to the context menu of InDesign.

You can use it as a **startup script** (recommended) or start it from the **script panel**. If you use it with the script panel, the entry is available in the context menu after script execution. 

## Script usage

1. Select the frame with the placed PDF, Illustrator or InDesign file
2. Right mouse click
3. Select the item "PDF Page Options ..."

In the dialog that appears you can change the options for the placed file.
